## kube-vip Maturity

The kube-vip project is deployed and used in a number of production environments and is included/bundled with a number of production Kubernetes based platforms. Whilst kube-vip could be thought of as pre-release, it has happily found it's home in places where it has ran production workloads. I cursary glance at time of writing this (mid-July 2022) also reveals that downloads combined from Docker Hub and GitHub container registry amount to around 19,000,000 kube-vip container pulls.
